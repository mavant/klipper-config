# Make M204 also set ACCEL_TO_DECEL.
# This is also slightly more flexible about syntax, in that it tolerates some
# commands which really would be invalid (mixing S with T and P, or failing to
# set both T and P). It does this basically because klipper already throws most
# of this information away anyhow.
#
# This macro is forked from
# https://github.com/danorder/Flsun-super-racer-Full-klipper-config-
# which was slightly less tolerant of invalid commands but also much more 
# verbose.
# Comment upstream reads:
#    IF ENABLED KEEP WALL ACCELERATION THE SAME WITH PRESSURE ADVANCE THIS ALSO 
#    APPLIES TO M205.
#    DO NOT FORGET KLIPPER DOES NOT USE JERK THE VALUES ARE NOT THE SAME AND 
#    SCALE WITH ACC.  THIS IS BOTH FOR COMPATABILITY WITH CERTAIN SLICERS AND 
#    FOR DYNAMIC ACC
#
#
# The underlying klipper command's docs read:
#    Note: If S is not specified and both P and T are specified, then the 
#    acceleration is set to the minimum of P and T. If only one of P or T is 
#    specified, the command has no effect.
#
#
# The marlin gcode M204 supports one more parameter, 'R', used for setting
# retraction acceleration. I don't really know of a good way
